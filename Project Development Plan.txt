Tips for Success
Start with the authentication system as it's fundamental to all other features
Use Postman to test your API endpoints before implementing frontend
Implement features one at a time and test thoroughly
Keep your code organized and well-documented
Use version control (Git) to track your progress
Test each component as you build it
Don't hesitate to look up documentation and examples
